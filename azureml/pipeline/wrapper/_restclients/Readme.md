The rest client code was autogenerated by AutoRest:  https://github.com/Azure/autorest

The following command was used to generate the code:
  autorest --input-file=swagger.json --output-folder=. --python --namespace=designer --override-client-name=DesignerServiceClient

Original swagger source: https://eastus.api.azureml.ms/studioservice/swagger/index.html

Simplifed and only keep the needed api.

The file service_caller.py is manually maintained and serves as a wrapper to the auto-generated code.
Files under "designer" folder are totally auto-generated, please do not edit them manually.
